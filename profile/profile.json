      "description": "Designed a Java application with a graphical interface made with Swing in which a user is able to view maps of buildings and see points of interest (POIs) of several buildings at Western University. An admin can add or remove POIs which are visible to all, or a user can add or remove their own POIs. These POIs as well as other building information are stored in JSON files, accessed using json-simple. The project was created by a team of four using a Waterfall methodology.",

      "description": "Collaborated with a group of students in an Agile Scrum environment to clone Flappy Bird in C++ and Qt, but changing the theme. The idea was that it would be efficient enough to be playable on the Raspberry Pi, which it was tested on. To make it efficient, I used memory saving techniques, such as reusing obstacles that exit the screen for the infinitely generated map rather than continually creating new ones.",

Within 48 hours, I had tought myself my way around the engine, and learned its own language, GDScript. I was able to create a working platformer with animations, enemies, different attacks and skills, sound effects and music, and a variety of levels.",

The stats are isolated using regular expressions, and then stored in a postgress SQL database within a docker container. Using crontab, these statistics can be pulled and stored by the minute. The project was created and tested on a Rocky Linux virtual machine hosted on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP).",

I've always been interested in software, attending hackathons since high school! However, working as a Data Analyst at RBC, I realized there is so much that can be automated for efficiency. While I was there, I automated what I could with respect to the data pulls, and I loved doing this, which brought me to DevOps! Prior to this, I had worked on software development projects in a variety of languages; you can see some of my projects below!"
